                Pizza is one of those foods where you can't really go wrong. You can eat it hot or cold, and you
                can put whatever you want on it. You can eat it after a couple of days, too (within reason!!). I personally
                prefer to leave it in the refrigerator for an hour or two to let the flavors mingle.
                Then, afterwards, I personally just throw it in the microwave. I've heard that "the best" way to reheat
                a slice of pizza is to saute it on low heat with a cover, but I haven't tried it.
                I want to lay on you what my ideal pizza is. <br>
                The mother of all pizzas.<br>
                MOAP.<br>
                It's got to have a good sauce-to-cheese-to-crust ratio. Too much of one or the other will throw the whole thing outta
                balance. Too much cheese? Too stringy and hard to eat. It'll burn your mouth if it's hot, too.<br>
                Too much sauce? You'll get a soggy mess of a slice. <br>
                Too much crust? Why not just take a bite out of a loaf of bread?<br>
                The balance, for me, is equal sauce to cheese (maybe a little less sauce), and double the crust.
                I prefer a thicker crust, by the way. New York-style is great, but I have my tastes just as you do yours.
                The crust should be house-made and yeast-y. None of that store-bought stuff.<br>
                The cheese shouldn't be so soft it falls off the slice. It should also have some flavor to it.<br>
                The sauce has got to have spices in it. <strong>That's</strong> where I like my flavor, in the sauce. <br>
                I've got to taste that beautiful oregano & basil in there. <br>
                Those are my thoughts on the perfect pizza. I hope you enjoyed reading and I hope you have a great day.

                Super Mario 64 is my faovrite video game of all time. I know it sounds crazy given what
                recent games have been doing with their graphics, and given what indies have been doing with 
                breaking the boundaries of conventional game design. But there is something about this game that just...
                always draws me in. I love hopping through its colorful environments, listening to Mario's voice.
                The levels are like a home away from home, for me. These are places I want to return to every now and then.
                I have no idea exactly why they're so special to me, but they are. <br>
                The colors pop. The environments are well-designed playgrounds for Mario to explore. The core gameplay loop
                is extremely fun and satisfying. Just the simple act of moving Mario around is fun, too.
                The whole game just has this childlike whimsy to it, this sense of grandure and exploration.
                I just love it. <br>
                And the music is timeless too. (I have literally fallen asleep to Dire Dire Docks, <strong>multiple times</strong>, don't judge.)<br>

                Peach's Castle is an interesing hub area that does a good job of bridging together the game's courses.
                While it can feel a little.. empty at times, it's still interesting to explore and offers the player platforming challenges
                in exchange for discovery of new courses.<br>
                Nintendo are geniuses. This game defined the 3D collect-a-thon genre. And they made this game in only TWO YEARS!! Wow.<br>
                <strong>Also, L is real 2401.</strong><br>
                No, seriously, Luigi was found in some of the game's source code. Google it. It's crazy. I cried. <br>

                Thanks for reading, and I hope you have a great day.
